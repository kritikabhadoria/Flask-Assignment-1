    "Q1. What is Flask Framework? What are the advantages of Flask Framework?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Flask** is a micro web framework written in Python. It is lightweight, modular, and flexible, making it an excellent choice for building web applications and APIs. Flask provides tools and libraries for handling HTTP requests, routing URLs, rendering templates, and managing sessions and cookies. It follows the WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) specification and can be easily integrated with third-party libraries and extensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of Flask Framework:\n",
    "1. Lightweight and minimalistic: Flask has a simple and minimalistic core, allowing developers to add only the features they need.\n",
    "2. Easy to learn and use: Flask has a straightforward and intuitive syntax, making it easy for beginners to get started with web development.\n",
    "3. Flexible and modular: Flask allows developers to choose and integrate third-party libraries and extensions according to their requirements.\n",
    "4. Extensive documentation and community support: Flask has comprehensive documentation and an active community, providing resources and support for developers.\n",
    "5. Built-in development server: Flask comes with a built-in development server, enabling developers to test and debug their applications easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. Create a simple Flask application to display ‘Hello World!!’. Attach the screenshot of the output in Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from flask import Flask\n",
    "\n",
    "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/')\n",
    "def hello_world():\n",
    "    return 'Hello World!!'\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "    app.run()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. What is App routing in Flask? Why do we use app routes?\n",
    "\n",
    "**App routing** in Flask refers to the process of mapping URLs to the corresponding view functions in a Flask application. It allows developers to define routes for different URLs and specify the functions that should be called when those URLs are accessed.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use app routes in Flask to define the endpoints of our web application. Each route corresponds to a specific URL path, and when a client sends a request to that URL, Flask invokes the associated view function to generate the HTTP response. App routes enable developers to create a logical structure for their web applications and define how different parts of the application respond to incoming requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. Create a “/welcome” route to display the welcome message “Welcome to ABC Corporation” and a “/” route to show the following details:\n",
    "Company Name: ABC Corporation\n",
    "Location: India\n",
    "Contact Detail: 999-999-9999\n",
    "Attach the screenshot of the output in Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from flask import Flask\n",
    "\n",
    "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/')\n",
    "def index():\n",
    "    return \"\"\"Company Name: ABC Corporation\n",
    "Location: India\n",
    "Contact Detail: 999-999-9999\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/welcome')\n",
    "def welcome():\n",
    "    return 'Welcome to ABC Corporation'\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "    app.run()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. What function is used in Flask for URL Building? Write a Python code to demonstrate the working of the url_for() function.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Flask, the `url_for()` function is used for URL building. It generates a URL for the specified endpoint by dynamically constructing the URL based on the endpoint and any additional arguments provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a Python code demonstrating the usage of the `url_for()` function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from flask import Flask, url_for\n",
    "\n",
    "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/')\n",
    "def index():\n",
    "    return 'Index Page'\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/hello')\n",
    "def hello():\n",
    "    return 'Hello, World!'\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/user/<username>')\n",
    "def profile(username):\n",
    "    return f'{username}\\'s Profile'\n",
    "\n",
    "with app.test_request_context():\n",
    "    print(url_for('index'))  # Output: '/'\n",
    "    print(url_for('hello'))  # Output: '/hello'\n",
    "    print(url_for('hello', next='/'))  # Output: '/hello?next=%2F'\n",
    "    print(url_for('profile', username='John Doe'))  # Output: '/user/John%20Doe'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `url_for()` function dynamically generates URLs for the specified endpoints (`index`, `hello`, `profile`) by using the endpoint names and any additional arguments provided."
